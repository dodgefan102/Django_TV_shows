# Django_TV_shows
This is a Full Stack Django app that is intended to make a log of TV shows, with their release date, the network they are made from, and a breif description of the show. 

The home page on the root route, displays a list of all TV shows added.

Clicking the "Add a New Show" link takes you to a page to add a new TV show to the list.
